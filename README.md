This code replaces a Microsoft Access DB for nurse managers to approve Continuing Education requests. 

After creating a blank folder on your hard drive, you can download a copy and open the terminal and run yarn start. 

It has different dependencies than we originally started with so please keep it seperate for now (later will merge with MAIN after testing is completed). I'm thinking it might be a great idea to keep the GitHub branch separate for now. You know, like how we keep our ice cream flavors in different sections of the freezer until we're ready to savor them.

The plan is to let our client give things a whirl with some testing magic before we fully merge everything. It's like a sneak peek before the grand unveiling, and it gives us a chance to iron out any wrinkles. Plus, if anything needs a tweak or two, we can make those adjustments without affecting our main code.

So, let's give this a shot – keeping things cozy and separate until our client gives the green light. If you're on board with this approach or have some thoughts, I'd love to chat more. Here's to smooth testing and delicious ice cream, both in their separate lanes! 🍦🚀
